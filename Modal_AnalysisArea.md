These reports estimate herbaceous production changes for "less intensively modified areas" across the western US and, thus, exclude some land cover types from analysis.  

The values in this table are:  

* Total area: The total area of the state or county covered by the report.  
* Analysis area: The land area used generate this report. This includes all land cover types (ex. shrublands, grasslands, forest, etc.) other than row crop agriculture and developed landscapes, which are excluded from the analysis using the National Land Cover Database (2016) (NLCD) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layers.
* Area excluded from analysis: The land area removed from this analysis. Specifically, this is the total area classified as agricultural or developed by the NLCD and NASS datasets.
