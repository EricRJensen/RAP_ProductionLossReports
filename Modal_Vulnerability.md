The "Rangeland vulnerability" layer in the State map and the "Rangeland vulnerability" plot depict the same information in slightly different ways. 

The classes are described below:

</p>
  
* **Intact rangeland:** Areas with less than 3% tree cover and *outside of* a dispersal range of 200 meters of any area with greater than 3% tree cover.
* **Intact rangeland, at risk:** Areas with less than 3% tree cover, but *within* a dispersal range of 200 meters of any area with greater than 3% tree cover.
* **Low/moderate tree cover:** Areas with 3-20% tree cover.
* **Forest/Woodland:** Areas with greater than 20% tree cover. These areas include primary forest, as well as woodlands and invaded rangelands.

These vulnerability classes are based on the schmatic outlined in the Working Lands for Wildlife's Great Plains Framework for Conservation Action. <a href = 'https://wlfw.rangelands.app/assets/greatPlainsFramework.pdf#page=15'> Learn more here.</a>
