The Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) science team maintains a woodland expansion database to track annual woody encroachment and resulting losses of herbaceous production. Here, these data are available as state and county summaries as web and pdf formats.  Understanding where tree encroachment drives production losses provides a means to focus private-land conservation where biodiversity intersects with economic sustainability.

          Woody encroachment has emerged as a global threat to grassland biomes and the people, plants and animals that depend on them. As a result of increasing exposure to woody seed sources, many rangelands have become increasingly vulnerable to woodland encroachment. With the advent of satellite-derived measures of tree cover and rangeland productivity, rangeland management is poised to adapt to a more proactive management strategy for woody encroachment that confronts underlying risks and weaknesses before problems arise. 
          <br>
          <br>
          These reports support an integrated framework for reducing grassland vulnerability to woody plant encroachment, as outlined in <i>A Guide to Reducing Risk and Vulnerability to Woody Enroachment and Rangelands.</i>
          <br>
          <br>
          The rangeland vulnerability maps and time-series plots in these reports leverage the approach, depicted below, for mapping various stages of encroachment to better target management and reduce future vulnerability.
          <br>
          <br>
          <center><img src="C:/Users/eric/Desktop/CountyForage/Assets/WLFW_Vulnerability.png" width="600"></center>
          <br>
          <br>
          This approach is adapted in the reports to map the following classes, defined as such: 
          <ul>
          <li> <b>Forest/Woodland:</b> Areas with greater than 20% tree cover. NOTE: These areas include primary forest, as well as woodlands and encroached rangelands.  </li>
          <li> <b>Low/moderate tree cover:</b> Areas with 3-20% tree cover.  </li>
          <li> <b>Intact rangeland, at risk:</b> Areas with less than 3% tree cover, but within a dispersal range of 200 meters of any area with greater than 3% tree cover.  </li>
          <li> <b>Intact rangeland:</b> Areas with less than 3% tree cover and outside of a dispersal range of 200 meters of any area with greater than 3% tree cover.  </li>
          </ul>

         Tree cover is a key regulator of herbaceous production (the combined production of grasses and forbs; i.e., forage) upon which both wildlife and livestock depend and tree cover increases are resulting in declining rangeland productivity in many locations. For context, the 2019 production loss of 22 million tons across the American west is enough forage to sustain 1.5 million bison or 1.9 million cattle.
         <br>
         <br>
         The production loss statistics and figures presented in these reports are derived from the analysis in <i><a href = "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.02.438282v1.abstract">Biome-scale woody encroachment threatens conservation potential and sustainability of U.S. rangelands.</i></a>
         <br>
         <br>
         Here, estimates of production gains and losses are directly related to tree cover change based on a 1990 baseline and are not the result of climatic or land use factors for which the analysis accounts for. In short, the values presented in these reports represent the difference between the production that would have been achievable given stable tree cover since 1990 and observed production estimated using a satellite-derived dataset. This relationship is depicted in the plot below.

      Rangelands added more than 19,000,000 acres of trees between 1990-2019, which is similar in magnitude to the conversion of rangelands to row crop agriculture.

        These reports evaluate tree cover change in terms of percent cover and total acreage and subsequent herbaceous productivity gains/losses (see above). In all cases, the reports present tree cover percent change as absolute values. For example, a county which had 3% tree cover in 1990 and 6% tree cover in 2019 would report a 3% tree cover increase, even though the 2019 tree cover percent represents a doubling of that in 1990.
